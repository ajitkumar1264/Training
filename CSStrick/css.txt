CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

CSS is the language we use to style a web Page.

What is CSS ? 

CSS stands for Cascading style Sheets.
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on Screen,paper, or in other media.
CSS saves a lot of work, it can control the layout of multiple we pages all at once.
External stylesheets are stored in css files.

Benifit of CSS

1) Faster page speed.
2) Better User Exprience.
3) Quicker Development Time.
4) Easy formatting changes.
5) compatibility Across Devices.

- External Style Sheet using < link >

when a browser reads a style sheet, it will formate the HTML document according to the information 
in the style sheet.

Three are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External CSS
with an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire webiste by changing just one file.

Each HTMl page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element,inside the head section.

example
<head>
<line rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>

An external style sheet can be written in any text editor,and must be saved with a .css extension.

the external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

Internal CSS
an internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
the internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

Inline CSS

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
to use inline styles,add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Cascading order
all the styles in a page will cascade into a new virtual style sheet by the following rules,where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline styles - highest priority
2. External and internal styles Sheets 
3. Browser default


CSS Comments

CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but the can help document you source code.

comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a late date.

comments are ignored by the Browser.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and start with /* and ends with */;

Id and Class : 

Id

The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

you cannot have more that one element with the same id in an HTML document.

class

The HTML class attribute is use to specify a class for HTML element.

Multiple HTML element can share the same class.



CSS Selector : 

CSs selectors are used to "find" the HTML elements you want to style.

we can divide CSS selectors in five categories.

simple selectors (select elements based on name,id and class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific reloationship between them)
psedo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


The CSS id selector

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so id selector is used to selct one unique element!.

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

The CSS class Selector 

The class selector selects HTML element with a specific class attribute.
To select element with a specific class, write a period(.) character, followed by the class name.

The CSS element seletor 

The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

The CSS universal selector

The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

The CSS grouping selector

The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Example : 

h1,h2,p{
    text-align : center;
    color:red;
}

Descendant / Child Selectors

Css combinations

a combinator is something that explains the reloationship between the selectors.

There are four different combinatots in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector(-)

Descendant selector
the descendant selctor matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

example :

div p{
    background-color:red;
}

child selctor (>)

The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

select all p elements that are the childeren fo a div element :

div >  p {

    background-color:red;
}

Adjacent sibling selector (+)

The adjacent sibling selector is use to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

example : select the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements :

div + p {
 
 background-color:Red;

}

General sibling selector ~

The genearal sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

div ~ p { 
    background-color:Red;
}


CSS Attribute Selectors

style HTML elements with specific attributes

it is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attributes value.

CSS [attribute] selector

the [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

example :

selects all <a> elements with a target attribute:

a[target]{
    background-color:red;
}

The [attribute = " value] selector is used to select element with a specifed attribute and value.

example : selects all <a>  elements with a target="_blank" attribute.

a[target="_blank"]{
    background-color:red;
}

The [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.

[title~="flower"] {
    border:5px solid red;
}

The [attribute|="value] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value 
can be exactly the specified value,or the specified value followed by ahyphen (-).

example : the value has to be a whole word ,either alone,like class="top", or followed by hypen(-),like class="top-text"

The [attribute^="top"] selector is used to select elements with specified attribute,whose value start with the specified value.

example selects all elements with a class attribute value that starts with "top" :

The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specifed value.

example selects all elements with a class attribute value that ends with "test" :

The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ccontains a specifed value.

example selects all elements with a class attribute value that conatins "te".

CSS Pseudo-classes

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

style an element when a user mouses over it.
style visited and unvisited links differently
style an element when it gets focus.

Syntax of pseudo-classes : 

selector:pseudo-class{
    property:value;
}

a:link{
    color:black;
}
a:visited{
    color:red;
}
a:hover{
    color:green;
}
a:active{
    color:blue;
}

pseudo-classes and HTML Classes 

pseudo-classes can be combined with HTML classes:

when you hover over the link in the example, it will change color:

div:hover{
    background:black;
}

CSS - The :first-child Pseudo-class

The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.

The selector matches any <p> element that is the first child of any element.

p:first-child{
    color:blue;
}
