<---------------------------AJAX------------------------------------------------>

ajax is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page-without reloading the whole page.

what is AJAX?

AJAX = Asynchronous Javascript and XML

In short; AJAX is about loading data in background and display it on the webpage,without reloading whole page.

examples of applications using AJAX : Gmail, Google Maps, Youtube, and Facebook tabs.

JQuery provides several methods for AjAX functionality.

With JQuery AJAX methods, you can request text,HTML,XML, or JSON from the remote server using HTTP GET and HTTP Post 0 and you can load the exteranl data directly
into the selcted HTML elemnts of you web page!

JQuery load method

The JQuery load() method is a simple, but powerful AJAX method.
The load() method load data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element.

Syntax:

$(selector).load(URL,data,callback);

The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to load.

The optional data parameter specifies a set of Querystring key/value pairs to send along with the request.

the Optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed after the load() method is completed.

The optional callback parameter specifies a callback function to run when the load() 
method is completed. The callback function can have different parameters:

responseTxt - contains the resulting content if the call succeeds
statusTxt - contains the status of the call
xhr -contains the XMLHttpRequest object

The JQuery get() and post() methods are used to request data from the server with an HTTP GET or POST request.

HTTP Request: GET vs. POST

Two commonly used methods for request-response between a client ans server are:
GET and POST.

GET - Request data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

GET is basically used for just getting (retriving) some data from the server. 
NOTE : The GET method may return cached data.
POST can also be used to get some data from the server.
NOTE : The POST method NEVER caches data

JQuery $.get() method

The $.get() method request data from the server with an HTTP GET request.

Syntax:

$.get(URL,callback);

URl page contain API value
Callback function contain two parameter data and status 

JQuery $.post() method request data from the server using an HTTP POST request.

Syntax:

$.post(URL,data,callback);

The required URl  parameter specifies the URL you wish to Request.

The optional data parameter spcifies some data to send along with the request.

 The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed if the request succeeds.


 JQuery - The noConflict() method

 what is you wish to use other framework on your pages

as you already know;JQuery uses the $ sign as a shortcut for jQuery.
There are many other popular Javascript frameworks like : Angular,Backbone,Ember knockout and more.

What if other JavaScript frameworks also use the $sing as a shortcut?

if two different frameworks are using the same shortcut, one of them might stop working.

The JQuery team have already thought about this, and implemented the noConflict() method.


The JQuery noConflict method

The noconfilct method releases the hold on the $ shortcut identifier, so that other scripts can use it.

Ajax JQuery method:

$.ajax()- performs an async AJAX request
The ajax() method is used to perform an AJAX (asychronous HTTP) request.

$.ajaxprefilter()-handle the custom ajax options or modify existing options before each request is end and before they are preocessed by $.ajax()

$.ajaxSetup() - sets the default values for future AJAX requests

$.ajaxTransport()-creates an object that handles the actual transmission of Ajax data.

$.get()-loads data from a server using an AJAX HTTP GET request

$.getScript() - Loads a javascript from a server using an AJAX HTTP GET Request

$.param() - creates a serialized representation of an array or object 

$.ajaxComplete() - method spedifies a function to be run when an ajax request is completed.

$.ajaxError()-sepcifies a function to run when the ajax request completes with an error

$.ajaxSend()-apecifies a function to run before the Ajax Request is sent

$.ajaxStart()-specifies a function to run when the first ajax request begins

$.ajaxStop()-specifies a function to run when all ajax requests have completed.

$.ajaxSuccess() -specifies a function to run when an AJAx request compltes successfully

$.load()- loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element.

$.serialize()-encodes a set of form elements as a string for submission.

Ajax - the XMLHttpRequest object
The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

all mordern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes.This means that it is possible to update parts of a web
page, without reloading the whole page.

For Security reasons,mordern browsers do not allow access across domains.
this means that both the web page and the XML file it tries to load, must be located on the same server.

method:

new XMLHttpRequest()-creates a new XMLHttpRequest object.
abort() - cancels the current request.
getAllResponseHeaders() - Returns header information
getResponseHeader()-Return specific header information
open(method,url,async,user,psw)-specifies the request
send()-Sends the request to the server
setRequestHeader() - adds a label/value pair to the header to be sent


XMLHttpRequest object properties :

onreadystatechange - defines a function tobe called when the readyState property changes
readyState - Holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest
0:request not initialized
1:server connection established
2.request received
3.processing request
4.request finished and response is readyState
responseText - returns the response data as a string
responseXML - Returns the response data as Xml data
status : Returns the status-number of a request
statusText - Returns the status-text


send a Request To a server

xhttp.open("GET","ajaxdoc.txt",true);
xhttp.send();

open()-specifies the type of request Get or post and Location and async

post Request Example :

xhttp.open("POST", "demo_post2.asp", true);
xhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhttp.send("fname=Henry&lname=Ford");
