JQuery Chaining

here using chaining, you can chain together action/Methods.

JQuery - Get content and attributes

JQuery contain powerful methods for chaining and manipulating HTML elements and attributes.

JQuery DOM manipulation

One very important part of JQuery is Possibility to manipulate to DOM

DOM defines a standard for accessing HTML and XML document

DOM stands for Document Object Model


GET Content - text(), html() and val()

text() - sets or return the text content of selected elements
html() - sets or rutruns the content of selected elements (including HTML markup)
val() - sets or returns the value of form fields

SET content - text(), html() and val()

same as the Get Content

JQuery - add elements

* Add new HTML Content

we will look at four jQuery method that are used to add new Content:

1.append()-Inserts content at the end of the selected elements

here the content is added after the element
example is 

the ajitkumar
after clicking the button
The ajitkumar vaghela

2.prepend()-Inserts content at the beginning of the selected elements

here the text or content is added before the elements
example is

ajitkumar vishnubhai
after clicking on the button
Vaghela ajitkumar vishnubhai

3.after()-inserts contents after the selected elements


here the text is added after the line 
example is

ajitkumar
after clicking on the button

ajitkumar
hardikvaghela

4.before()-inserts content before the selected elements

here the text is added before the line 
example is

ajitkumar
after clicking on the button 

hardikvaghela
ajitkumar


append and prepend is inline element
after and before is block level element


both can take infinite nubmer of elements as parameters


jquery - Remove elements

To remove elements and content, ther are mainly two jQuery Methods:

1.remove()-Removes the selected element (and its child elements)
2.empty()-Removes the child elements from the selcted element


here the remove function remove whole element
where empty function remove the content or child of the selcted elements

1.addClass()-Adds one or more classes to the selcted elements
2.removeclass()-Removes one or more classes from the selected elements
3.toggleClass()-Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selcted elements
4.css() - Sets or return the style attributes

css({"color":"red","font-size":"30px"})


JQuery Dimension Methods:

1.width()
2.height()
3.innerWidth()
